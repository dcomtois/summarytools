# Summarytools 1.0 is out!

**summarytools** is a an [*R*](https://www.r-project.org) package for
data cleaning, exploring, and simple reporting. The package was
developed with the following objectives in mind:

-   Provide a coherent set of easy-to-use descriptive functions that are
    akin to those included in commercial statistical software suites
    such as SAS, SPSS, and Stata
-   Offer flexibility in terms of output format & content  
-   Integrate well with commonly used software & tools for reporting
    (the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) IDE,
    [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and
    [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/)) while also allowing for
    standalone, simple report generation from any R interface

On a more personal level, I simply wish to share with the R community
and the scientific community at large the functions I first developed
for myself, that I ultimately realized would benefit a lot of people who
are looking for the same thing I was seeking in the first place.

## Support *summarytools*’ Development

If **summarytools** helps you get things done, please consider making a
donation. By doing so now, you’ll help me feel useful, but more
importantly contribute to the package’s development and help other
people like you who benefit from its current and *future features*. I
regularly receive feature requests, and when I receive donations, I set
aside some time to work on them, making summarytools even more relevant
for data scientists, students and researchers around the world. No
matter how small the amount is, I always appreciate the gesture. A list
of sponsors can be found [further below](#sponsors).

# Installing summarytools

### Required Software

Additional software is used by **summarytools** for fine-tuning graphics
as well as offering interactive functionality. If you are installing
**summarytools** for the first time, click on the relevant link to get
OS-specific instructions. On Windows, no additional software is
required.

<a href="#required-mac-os">Mac OS X</a>  
<a href="#required-debian">Ubuntu / Debian / Mint</a>  
<a href="#required--older-ubuntu">Older Ubuntu (14 and 16)</a>  
<a href="#required-fedora">Fedora / Red Hat / CentOS</a>  
<a href="#required-solaris">Solaris</a>

### Installing From GitHub

This method has the advantage of benefiting from minor fixes and
improvements that are added between CRAN releases. Its main drawback is
that you won’t be noticed when a new version is available. You can
either check this page from time to time, or best, use a package that
checks for package updates on various repositories, such as
[dtupdate](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/dtupdate) and
[Drat](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/drat.html).

``` r
install.packages("remotes")        # Using devtools is also possible
library(remotes)
install_github("rapporter/pander") # Strongly recommended
install_github("dcomtois/summarytools", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Installing From CRAN

CRAN versions are stable but are not updated as often as the GitHub
versions. On the plus side, they can be easier to install on some
systems.

``` r
install.packages("summarytools")
```

# Latest Changes

-   In `dfSummary()`:

    -   It is now possible to control which statistics to show in the
        *Freqs / Values* column (see
        `help("st_options", "summarytools")` for examples)  
    -   In *html* outputs, tables are better aligned horizontally
        (categories \>\> counts \>\> charts); if misalignment occurs,
        adjusting `graph.magnif` should resolve it
    -   List-type columns and `Inf` values are handled properly

-   In `descr()` and `ctable()` several display glitches were corrected

-   Selected heading elements can be totally omitted on an individual
    basis

-   Improved functionality for customized terms / translations

For more details, see `vignette("introduction", "summarytools")` as well
as `news(package = "summarytools")`.
