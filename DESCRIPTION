Title: Dataframe Summaries, Frequency Tables and Descriptive Stats with
    Various Output Formats
Version: 0.65
Date: 2016-12-04
Author: Dominic Comtois

Description: Built around three key functions: 1) freq() generates
    frequency tables reporting counts and proportions (including cumulative) for factors
    and other discrete data; 2) descr() gives all common central tendency statistics and 
    measures of dispersion for numerical data; 3) dfSummary() gives as much information
    as possible on a dataframe's columns in a legible table. freq() and
    descr() support weights, and all three functions support 'Hmisc' or 'pander' labels.  
    A variety of output formats are available (plain text, 'rmarkdown' and HTML).
    An additional misc function, what.is(), displays all common properties of an object
    (its class, type, mode, attributes, etc.) and extends the base is() function, 
    checking the object against most is.() functions.
