Description: Includes 3 summarizing functions; one for categorical data (freq),
    one for numerical (uni or multidimensional) data (desc), and one
    exclusively for dataframes. 'freq' generates frequency tables with valid
    and total proportions. 'desc' generates common central tendency statistics
    and measures of dispersion for numerical data. 'dfSummary' will generate a
    table containing as many rows as there are columns, each row giving
    variable information (class and type), labels if any, common statistics for
    numerical data and frequency tables for any type of data, along with number
    and proportion of valid (non-missing) values.
