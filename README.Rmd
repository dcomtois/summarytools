# 1. Overview

**summarytools** is a an [*R*](https://www.r-project.org) package for data exploration and simple reporting. 

**Four functions** are at its core:

| Function | Description |
|---------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <a href="#freq">`freq()`</a> | **Frequency Tables** featuring counts, proportions, as well as missing data information |
| <a href="#ctable">`ctable()`</a> | **Cross-Tabulations** (joint frequencies) between pairs of discrete variables featuring marginal sums as well as row, column or total proportions |
| <a href="#descr">`descr()`</a> | **Descriptive (Univariate) Statistics** for numerical data featuring common measures of central tendency and dispersion |
| <a href="#dfsummary">`dfSummary()`</a> | Extensive **Data Frame Summaries** featuring type-specific information for all variables in a data frame: univariate statistics and/or frequency distributions, bar charts or histograms, as well as missing data counts. Very useful to quickly detect anomalies and identify trends at a glance |


## 1.1 Motivation

The package was developed with the following objectives in mind:

 - Provide a coherent set of easy to use descriptive functions that are
   akin to those included in commercial statistical packages such
   as SAS, SPSS, and Stata  
 - Offer flexibility in terms of output formats & contents  
 - Integrate well with commonly used software & tools for reporting
   ([the RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/),
   [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/))
   while also allowing for stand-alone, simple report generation  

On a more personal level, I simply wish to share with the R community and
the scientific community at large the functions I first developed for myself,
that I ultimately realized would benefit a lot of people who are looking for
the same thing I was seeking in the first place. 

### Encourage *summarytools*' Development With a Small Donation
Some package developers and maintainers get paid to do exactly that. They
may also work in teams. _This is not my case_. Seeing the package grow
in popularity was and still is in itself a rewarding experience, but I won't
lie; keeping up with the maintenance, feature requests and other features
I have in mind takes more time than I can afford.

So if you find **summarytools** useful and want to support its development,
please consider making a small donation using the *PayPal* link at the top of
this page. In exchange, you'll get:

  - My sincere gratitude
  - A space with your name in the future _Sponsors_ section of this page
  - My personal commitment to dedicate more time to the package's development


## 1.2 Redirecting Outputs

Results can be

 - Displayed in the *R* console as plain text  
 - Rendered as *html* and shown in RStudio's Viewer or in a Web Browser  
 - Written to / appended to plain text, *markdown*, or *html* files
 - Used in *Rmarkdown* reports  

## 1.3 Other Characteristics

 - **Pipe-Friendly**:  
   + The `%>%` and `%$%` operators from 
     the [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr) package are supported  
   + The `%>>%` operator from the [pipeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pipeR)
     package is also supported  
 - **Multilingual**:  
   + Built-in translations exist for French, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Turkish  
   + Users can easily add custom translations or modify existing sets of
     translations as needed  
 - **Weights-ready**: except for `dfSummary()`, all core functions support sampling 
   weights 
 - **Flexible**: 
   + Default values for most function arguments can be modified using `st_options()`;
     this simplifies coding and minimizes redundancy 
   + [**Pander options**](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/) can be used for text /
     markdown tables
   + [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) and user-defined *CSS* classes can be
     used for *html* tables

## 1.4 Installing summarytools

### Required Software

Additional software is used by **summarytools** to fine-tune
graphics as well as offer interactive features. If installing
**summarytools** for the first time, click on the link corresponding
to your Operating System to get detailed instructions. Note that
on Windows, no additional software is required.

<a href="#required-mac-os">Mac OS X</a>  
<a href="#required-debian">Ubuntu / Debian / Mint</a>  
<a href="#required--older-ubuntu">Older Ubuntu (14 and 16)</a>  
<a href="#required-fedora">Fedora / Red Hat / CentOS</a>  
<a href="#required-solaris">Solaris</a>  

### Installing From GitHub

This is the recommended method, as some minor fixes and improvements
are regularly added.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") # Using devtools is also possible
library(remotes)
install_github("rapporter/pander") # Necessary for optimal results!
install_github("dcomtois/summarytools")
```

### Installing From CRAN

CRAN versions are stable but are not updated as often as the GitHub versions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("summarytools")
```

## 1.5 Latest Features

Version 0.9.7 brings along...
 - Performance and formatting improvements
 - The `stview()` function which ensures the package's own `view()` method
   is used (avoiding potential conflicts with other packages' versions of
   that method)
 - Several other features detailed in the news section (see NEWS.md or try
   `news(package="summarytools"`))
 
# 2. The Four Core Functions 

## <a id="freq"></a>2.1 Frequency Tables With freq()

The `freq()` function generates frequency tables with counts,
proportions, as well as missing data information.

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

In this first example, the `plain.ascii` and `style` arguments were
specified. However, since we have defined them globally for this document
using `st_options()`, they are redundant and will be omitted from hereon.

### 2.1.1 Ignoring Missing Data

The `report.nas` argument can be set to `FALSE` in order to
ignore missing values (*NA*'s). Doing so has the following
effects on the resulting table:

 1. The **\<NA\>** row is omitted  
 2. The **% Total** and **% Total Cum.** columns are also omitted  
 3. The **% Valid** column simply becomes **%**  
 4. The **% Valid Cum.** column simply becomes **% Cum.**  

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

Note that the `headings = FALSE` parameter suppresses the heading section.

### 2.1.2 Minimal Frequency Tables

By "switching off" all optional elements, a much simpler table will be produced:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, 
     cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

### 2.1.3 Multiple Frequency Tables

To generate frequency tables for all variables in a data frame, no need to use
`lapply()`; `freq()` handles whole data frames, too:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
freq(tobacco)
```

To avoid cluttering the results, numerical columns having more
than 25 distinct values will be discarded. This threshold of 
25 can be changed by using for example
`st_options(freq.ignore.threshold = 10)`.

**Note**: the *tobacco* data frame contains simulated data and is
included in the package.

### 2.1.4 Subsetting (Filtering) Frequency Tables

The `rows` parameter allows subsetting frequency tables; we can
use this parameter it different ways:

 - To filter rows by their order of appearance, we use a numerical vector;
   `rows = 1:10` will show the frequencies for the first 10 values only 
 - To filter rows by name, we can use  
   + a character vector specifying the exact row names
     we wish to keep in the results  
   + a single character string which will be used as a
     regular expression to select the matching column(s);
     see `?regex` for more information on regular expressions  

Used in combination with the `order` argument, the subsetting feature
can be quite practical. For a character variable containing a large number
of distinct values, showing only the most frequent is easily done:

```{r}
freq(tobacco$disease, order = "freq", rows = 1:5)
```

Instead of `"freq"`, we can use `"-freq"` to reverse the ordering and
get results ranked from lowest to highest in frequency. 

To account for the frequencies of unshown values, the "**(Other)**" row is
automatically added.

### 2.1.5 Collapsible Sections

When generating *html* results, use the `collapse = TRUE` argument with
`print()` or `view()` to get collapsible sections; clicking on the variable
name in the heading section will collapse / reveal the frequency table (results
not shown).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(freq(tobacco), collapse = TRUE)
```

## <a id="ctable"></a>2.2 Cross-Tabulations with ctable()

`ctable()` generates cross-tabulations (joint frequencies) for
pairs of categorical variables. 

Since *markdown* does not support multiline table headings
(but does accept *html* code), we'll use the *html* rendering
feature for this section.

Using the *tobacco* data frame, we'll cross-tabulate the two
categorical variables *smoker* and *diseased*.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(ctable(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased, prop = "r"),
      method = "render")
```
<img src="img/ctable-with-row-props.png" style="border:0"/>

### 2.2.1 Row, Column or Total Proportions

Row proportions are shown by default. To display *column* or *total*
proportions, use `prop = "c"` or `prop = "t"`, respectively. To omit
proportions altogether, use `prop = "n"`.

### 2.2.2 Minimal Cross-Tabulations

By "switching off" all optional features, we get a simple “2 x 2” table:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(x = smoker, y = diseased, prop = 'n',
                  totals = FALSE, headings = FALSE),
           method = "render"))
```
<img src="img/ctable-barebones-2.png" style="border:0"/>

### 2.2.3 Chi-Square (&#120536;<sup>2</sup>), Odds Ratio and Risk Ratio

To display the chi-square statistic, set `chisq = TRUE`. For
*2 x 2* tables, use `OR` and `RR` to show odds ratio and
risk ratio (also called relative risk), respectively. Those can
be set to `TRUE`, in which case 95% confidence intervals will be
shown; to use alternate confidence levels, use for example `OR = .90`.

To show how pipes can be used with **summarytools**, we'll
use **magrittr**'s `%$%` and `%>%` operators:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
tobacco %$%  # Acts like with(tobacco, ...)
  ctable(smoker, diseased,
         chisq = TRUE, OR = TRUE, RR = TRUE,
         headings = FALSE) %>%
  print(method = "render")
```
<img src="img/ctable-chisq.png" style="border:0"  width=500px/>


## <a id="descr"></a>2.3 Descriptive Statistics With descr()

`descr()` generates descriptive / univariate statistics, *i.e.* common central
tendency statistics and measures of dispersion. It accepts single
vectors as well as data frames; in the latter case, all non-numerical columns
are ignored, with a message to that effect. 

```{r}
descr(iris)
```

### 2.3.1 Transposing and Selecting Statistics

Results can be transposed by using `transpose = TRUE`, and statistics
can be selected using the `stats` argument:

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd"), transpose = TRUE, headings = FALSE)
```

See `?descr` for a list of all available statistics. Special values 
“all”, “fivenum”, and “common” are also valid values for the `stats`
argument. The default value is “all”.


## <a id="dfsummary"></a>2.4 Data Frame Summaries With dfSummary() 

`dfSummary()` creates a summary table with statistics, frequencies and graphs
for all variables in a data frame. The information displayed is
type-specific (character, factor, numeric, date) and also varies according to
the number of distinct values.

To see the results in RStudio's Viewer (or in the default Web browser if
working in another IDE or from a terminal window), we use the `view()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
![dfSummary Output displayed in RStudio's viewer](img/dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png)

### 2.4.1 Using dfSummary() in Rmarkdown Documents

When using `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents, it is generally a good 
idea to exclude a column or two to avoid margin overflow. Since the *Valid*
and *Missing* columns are redundant, we can drop either one of them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid", 
          graph.magnif = 0.75, valid.col = FALSE, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp")
```

![dfSummary-md](img/dfSummary_md.png)

**The `tmp.img.dir` parameter is mandatory** when generating *dfSummaries* in
*Rmarkdown* documents, except for *html* rendering. The 
explanation for this can be found [further below](#tmp-img-dir). 

### 2.4.2 Advanced Features

This function

 - Reports the number of duplicate records in the heading section  
 - Detects UPC/EAN codes (barcode numbers) and doesn't calculate irrelevant
   statistics for them  
 - Detects email addresses and reports counts of valid, invalid and
   duplicate addresses  

### 2.4.3 Excluding Columns

Although most columns can be excluded using the function's parameters, it
is also possible to delete them with the following syntax (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfs <- dfSummary(iris)
dfs$Variable <- NULL # This deletes the "Variable" column
```
 
 
# 3. Grouped Statistics Using stby()

To produce optimal results, **summarytools** has its own version of
the base `by()` function. It's called `stby()`, and we use it exactly as we
would `by()`:

```{r}
(iris_stats_by_species <- stby(data = iris, 
                               INDICES = iris$Species, 
                               FUN = descr, stats = "common", transpose = TRUE))
```

## 3.1 Special Case of descr() with stby()

When used to produce split-group statistics for a single variable, `stby()`
assembles everything into a single table instead of displaying a series
of one-column tables.

```{r}
with(tobacco, stby(data = BMI, INDICES = age.gr, 
                   FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
```

## 3.2 Using stby() With ctable()

The syntax is a little trickier for this one, so here is an example
(results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stby(list(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased), 
     INDICES = tobacco$gender, FUN = ctable)

# or equivalently
with(tobacco, 
     stby(list(x = smoker, y = diseased), 
          INDICES = gender, FUN = ctable))
```

# 4. Grouped Statistics Using dplyr::group_by()

To create grouped statistics with `freq()`, `descr()` or `dfSummary()`, it is
possible to use **dplyr**'s `group_by()` as an alternative to `stby()`. Syntactic
differences aside, one key distinction is that `group_by()` considers
`NA` values on the grouping variables as a valid category, albeit with a warning
message suggesting the use of `forcats::fct_explicit_na` to make `NA`'s explicit
in factors. Following this advice, we get:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
tobacco$gender %<>% forcats::fct_explicit_na()
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(magrittr)
tobacco$gender %<>% forcats::fct_explicit_na()
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

# 5. Creating Tidy Tables With tb()

When generating `freq()` or `descr()` tables, it is possible to turn the
results into "tidy" tables with the use of the `tb()` function (think of
*tb* as a diminutive for *tibble*). For example:

```{r, results='markup'}
library(magrittr)
iris %>% descr(stats = "common") %>% tb()
iris$Species %>% freq(cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE) %>% tb()
```

By definition, no total rows are part of *tidy* tables, and the row
names are converted to a regular column. Note that for displaying
*tibbles* using *Rmarkdown*, the **knitr** chunk option 'results'
should be set to "markup" instead of "asis".

## 5.1 Tidy Split-Group Statistics

Here are some examples showing how lists created using `stby()` or `group_by()` can
be transformed into *tidy tibbles*.

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_descr <- stby(data = exams, INDICES = exams$gender, 
                      FUN = descr, stats = "common")
grouped_descr %>% tb()
```

The `order` parameter controls row ordering:
```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 2)
```

Setting `order = 3` changes the order of the sort variables exactly as with
`order = 2`, but it also reorders the columns:

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 3)
```

For more details, see `?tb`.

## 5.2 A Bridge to Other Packages 

**summarytools** objects are not always compatible with packages
focused on table formatting, such as
[formattable](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=formattable) or
[kableExtra](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kableExtra).
However, `tb()` can be used as a "bridge", an intermediary step
turning `freq()` and `descr()` objects into simple tables that any
package can work with. Here is an example using **kableExtra**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
stby(iris, iris$Species, descr, stats = "fivenum") %>%
  tb(order = 3) %>%
  kable(format = "html", digits = 2) %>%
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top")
```
![tb-kableExtra](img/tb-kableExtra.png)

# 6. Redirecting Output to Files

Using the `file` argument with `print()` or `view()`, we can write outputs
to a file, be it *html*, *Rmd*, *md*, or just plain text (*txt*). The file
extension is used to determine the type of content to write out.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.md")
```

**A Note About *PDF* documents**

There is no direct way to create a *PDF* file with **summarytools**. One option is
to generate an *html* file and convert it to *PDF* using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
or [WK\<html\>TOpdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html) (the latter gives better results
than Pandoc with `dfSummary()` output). Another option is to create an *Rmd* document
using *PDF* as the output format, but with a caveat: displaying graphs with `dfSummary()`
will cause vertical misalignment (we hope to resolve this issue in a future version).

## 6.1 Appending Output Files

The `append` argument allows adding content to existing files generated by
**summarytools**. This is useful if we wish to include several statistical
tables in a single file. It is a quick alternative to creating an *Rmd*
document.

# 7. Global options

The following options can be set with `st_options()`:

st_options(style = 'rmarkdown',   # Set the value of one or several options
           footnote = NA)         # Turn off the footnote for all html output
```

# 8. Overriding Formatting Attributes

When a **summarytools** object is created, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, we can override most of them when using
`print()` or `view()`.

## 8.1 Overriding Function-Specific Arguments

This table indicates what arguments can be used with `print()`
or `view()` to override formatting attributes:


| Argument         | freq   | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| ---------------: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| style            |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| round.digits     |   x    |   x    |   x   |           |
| plain.ascii      |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |

## 8.2 Overriding Heading Contents

To change the information shown in the heading section,
use the following arguments with `print()` or `view()`:

| Argument           | freq   | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| -----------------: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| Data.frame         |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Data.frame.label   |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Variable           |   x    |   x    |   x   |           |
| Variable.label     |   x    |   x    |   x   |           |
| Group              |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| date               |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Weights            |   x    |        |   x   |           |
| Data.type          |   x    |        |       |           |
| Row.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |
| Col.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |


### Example

In the following example, we will override three formatting, 
and one heading attribute:

```{r}
(age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)) 
print(age_stats, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, display.type = FALSE,
      Variable.label = "Age Group")
```

## 8.3 Order of Priority for Parameters / Options

1.  `print()` or `view()` parameters have precedence (overriding feature)  
2.  `freq() / ctable() / descr() / dfSummary()` parameters come second  
3.  Global options set with `st_options()` come third  

# 9. Fine-Tuning Looks with CSS

When creating *html* reports, both [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)'s 
*CSS* and *summarytools.css* are included by default. For greater control
on the looks of *html* content, it is also possible to add class
definitions in a custom *CSS* file. 

### Example

We need to use a very small font size for a simple *html*
report containing a `dfSummary()`. For this, we create a
*.css* file (with the name of our choosing) which contains
the following class definition:

```css
.tiny-text {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

Then we use `print()`'s `custom.css` argument to specify to location of
our newly created *CSS* file (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
      table.classes = 'tiny-text', file = "tiny-tobacco-dfSummary.html")
```

# 10. Creating *Shiny* apps

To successfully include **summarytools** functions in *Shiny* apps,

 - use *html* rendering  
 - set `bootstrap.css = FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - set `headings = FALSE` in case problems arise  
 - adjust graph sizes with `print()`'s `graph.magnif` parameter or
   with the `dfSummary.graph.magnif` global option  
 - if `dfSummary()` tables are too wide, omit a column or two (`valid.col` and `varnumbers`,
   for instance)  
 - if the results are still unsatisfactory, set column widths manually with `print()`'s
   `col.widths` parameter  

**Example** (results not shown)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(somedata, varnumbers = FALSE, valid.col = FALSE, 
                graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

# 11. Graphs in Markdown dfSummaries {#tmp-img-dir}

When using `dfSummary()` in an *Rmd* document using *markdown*
styling (as opposed to *html* rendering), three elements are
needed in order to display the *png* graphs properly:

  1 - `plain.ascii` must be set to FALSE  
  2 - `style` must be set to "grid"  
  3 - `tmp.img.dir` must be defined  

Why the third element? Although *R* makes it really easy to 
create temporary files and directories, they do have long pathnames,
especially on Windows. Unfortunately, Pandoc determines the final
(rendered) column widths by counting characters in a cell, 
even if those characters are paths pointing to images.

At this time, there seems to be only one solution around this problem:
cut down on characters in image paths. So instead of this:
```
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable  | Graph                                                               | Valid   |
+===========+=====================================================================+=========+
| gender\   | ![](C:/Users/johnny/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpYRgetx/file5aa44d71.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]  |                                                                     | (97.8%) |
+----+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

...we aim for this:
```
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
| Variable      | Graph                | Valid   |
+===============+======================+=========+
| gender\       | ![](/tmp/ds0001.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]      |                      | (97.8%) |
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
```

CRAN policies are really strict when it comes to writing content in 
the user directories, or anywhere outside *R's temporary zone* (for good 
reasons). So the users need to set this location themselves,
therefore consenting to having content written outside 
*R*'s predefined temporary zone.

On Mac OS and Linux, using "/tmp" makes a lot of sense: it's a short path,
and it's self-cleaning. On Windows, there is no such convenient directory, so
we need to pick one -- be it absolute ("/tmp") or relative ("img",
or simply "."). Two things are to be kept in mind: it needs to be short
(5 characters max) and it needs to be cleaned up manually.

# 12. Translations

Thanks to the *R* community's efforts, the following languages can be used,
in addition to English (default):
French (*fr*), Portuguese (*pt*), Russian (*ru*), Spanish (*es*),
and Turkish (*tr*).

To switch languages, simply use 

```{r}
st_options(lang = "fr")
```

All output from the core functions will now use that language:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species)
```

## 12.1 Non-UTF-8 Locales

On most Windows systems, it will be necessary to change the `LC_CTYPE` element
of the locale settings if the character set is not included in the system's
default locale. For instance, in order to get good results with the Russian
language in a "latin1" environment, we need to do the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "russian")
st_options(lang = 'ru')
```

Then to go back to default settings:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "")
st_options(lang = "en")
```

## 12.2 Defining and Using Custom Translations

Using the function `use_custom_lang()`, it is possible to add your own set of 
translations. To achieve this, get the 
[csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcomtois/summarytools/master/translations/language_template.csv),
customize the +/- 70 items, and call `use_custom_lang()`, giving it as
sole argument the path to the edited *csv* template. Note that such
custom translations will not persist across R sessions. This means that
you should always have this *csv* file handy for future use.

## 12.3 Defining Specific Keywords

Sometimes, all you might want to do is change just a few keywords -- for instance,
you could prefer using "N" instead of "Freq" in the title row of `freq()` tables. 
For this, use `define_keywords()`. Calling this function without any arguments will
bring up, on systems that support graphical devices (the vast majority, that is),
an editable window allowing to modify only the desired item(s).

<img src="img/define_keywords.png" width=95% style="border:2px;border-color:grey" />

After closing the edit window, you will be able to export the resulting
"custom language" into a *csv* file that you can reuse in the future by 
calling `use_custom_lang()`.

It is also possible to programmatically define one or several
keywords using `define_keywords()`. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
define_keywords(freq = "N")
```

See `?define_keywords` for more details.
