Version 0.4
-----------
Added cat() functions to fully support knitr's document generation. Also added sample datasets so that users can experiment using summarytools functions with them.

Version 0.3
-----------
Another round of major changes.

  - Bringing in html table built with htmltools and viewable in RStudio's Viewer
  - function desc is renamed descr (mainly to avoid conflict with plyr's desc)
  - argument "echo" is deprecated; either display with pander or use as.table()
  - Returned objects are now of class "summarytools" and have several attributes that are used by print.summarytools
	  * st.type : one of "freq", "descr" and "dfSummary"
  	* date : date at which the function was called
  	* var.name & var.label : for 'freq', and also 'desc' when a single vector is used.
  	* pander.args : 'style', 'justify', 'plain.ascii', 'split.table'
  - print.summarytools has argument "method" that can be one of "pander", "viewer", or "browser", the last two being used to display an html version of the output, using bootstrap's css (getbootstrap.com)
  - rows indexing is "detected" and reported (function .parse.arg.x takes care of this)
  - rounding now only occurs at the printing stage


Version 0.2
-----------
Several major changes since version 0.1

  - 'unistats' is now called 'desc'.
  - 'frequencies' is now called 'freq'.
  - 'properties' is now called 'prop'.
  - shortcuts have been added to keep backward-compatibility.
  - 'desc' now accepts dataframes as first argument; factors and character columns will be ignored.
  - 'desc' can be transposed to suit one's preferences.
  - 'freq' just returns a matrix-table, not a list anymore.
  - in 'desc' and 'freq', no more argument 'display.label'. Those are displayed automatically when present.
  - rapportools is used instead of Hmisc for variable labels
  - function 'properties' was removed for now. Maybe reintegrated in a future update.
