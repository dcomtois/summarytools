Version 0.6.9
-------------
Introduced ctable() for cross-tabulations. Added support for by() and with() - variable names and by-groups are now labelled correctly, and view() prints objects generated with by() in a convenient way. Appending to HTML files is now supported. Pander options stored in summarytools objects can now be overridden when using print() or view(). The file= parameter must now be used with print() or view(); its use with other functions is deprecated. freq() has an new order= parameter allowing to order rows by count rather than values sorted alphabetically. Improved alignment of numbers in descr() tables.

Version 0.6.5
------------
Fixed a problem with dfSummary() which arose when number of factors exceeded max.distinct.values. Improved the way dfSummary() reports frequencies on character variables. Fixed problems with outputs when using weights. Added hashtags to table headings to improve markdown integration. Added an option to generic print() function to suppress the footer in HTML outputs.

Version 0.6
-----------
Added Introduction vignette. Fixed markdown output that would not render strings such as <NA>. Improved multiline tables linefeeds. Introduced cleartmp() function to delete temporary HTML files used with print method "viewer" or "browser". Modifications to sample datasets. Bootstrap stylesheets now only include table-specific elements. Changed the way method="browser" sends file path to browser for better cross-platform compatibility. Improved results when using by(). Since version 0.5 was only made available through devtools::install_github(), please see changes for that version if updating from CRAN.

Version 0.5
-----------
Function descr() now also supports weights. Output from what.is() has been simplified. Other changes are transparent to the user (but make the internals more consistent across functions).

Version 0.4
-----------
Added cat() functions to fully support knitr's document generation. Also added sample datasets so that users can experiment using summarytools functions with them. freq() now supports weights.

Version 0.3
-----------
Another round of major changes.

  - Bringing in HTML table built with htmltools and viewable in RStudio's Viewer
  - function desc is renamed descr (mainly to avoid conflict with plyr's desc)
  - argument "echo" is deprecated; either display with pander or use as.table()
  - Returned objects are now of class "summarytools" and have several attributes that are used by print.summarytools
	  * st.type : one of "freq", "descr" and "dfSummary"
  	* date : date at which the function was called
  	* var.name & var.label : for 'freq', and also 'desc' when a single vector is used.
  	* pander.args : 'style', 'justify', 'plain.ascii', 'split.table'
  - print.summarytools has argument "method" that can be one of "pander", "viewer", or "browser", the last two being used to display an HTML version of the output, using bootstrap's css (getbootstrap.com)
  - rows indexing is "detected" and reported (function .parse.arg.x takes care of this)
  - rounding now only occurs at the printing stage


Version 0.2
-----------
Several major changes since version 0.1

  - 'unistats' is now called 'desc'.
  - 'frequencies' is now called 'freq'.
  - 'properties' is now called 'prop'.
  - shortcuts have been added to keep backward-compatibility.
  - 'desc' now accepts dataframes as first argument; factors and character columns will be ignored.
  - 'desc' can be transposed to suit one's preferences.
  - 'freq' just returns a matrix-table, not a list anymore.
  - in 'desc' and 'freq', no more argument 'display.label'. Those are displayed automatically when present.
  - rapportools is used instead of Hmisc for variable labels
  - function 'properties' was removed for now. Maybe reintegrated in a future update.
