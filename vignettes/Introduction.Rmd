*summarytools* is an *R* package providing tools
to *neatly and quickly summarize data*.  It can also make _R_ a little easier to 
learn and use. Four functions are at the core of the package:

  - `freq()` : **frequency tables** with proportions, cumulative
    proportions and missing data information.
  - `ctable()` : **cross-tabulations** between two factors or any
    discrete data, with total, rows or columns proportions, as well
    as marginal totals.
  - `descr()` : **descriptive (univariate) statistics** for numerical data.
  - `dfSummary()` : Extensive **data frame summaries** that facilitate
    data cleaning and firsthand evaluation.

An emphasis has been put on both _what_ and _how_ results are presented, so that the
package can serve both as a data exploration _and_ reporting tool, which can be used
either on its own for minimal reports, or along with larger sets of tools such as
RStudio's for [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/).

**Building on the strengths of [pander](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) and
[htmltools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)**, the 
outputs produced by summarytools can be:

  - Displayed in plain text in the *R* console (default behaviour)
  - Used in *Rmardown* documents and *knitted* along with other text and
    *R* output
  - Written to *html* files that fire up in
    [*RStudio*](http://www.rstudio.com/)’s Viewer pane or in your
    system’s default browser
  - Written to plain text files / *Rmarkdown* text files

### Latest Improvements

Version 0.8.3 brings several improvements to *summarytools*, notably:

 - Introduction of global settings (customizable defaults)
 - Options to make content fit more naturally in _shiny_ apps or _Rmarkdown_ documents
 - A better handling of "split-group" statistics with `by()`
 - A more thorough documentation

## summarytool's Core Functions

## 1 - freq() : Frequency Tables

The `freq()` function generates a table of frequencies with counts and
proportions. Since this page use *markdown* rendering, we’ll set `style
= 'rmarkdown'` to take advantage of it.

```{r}
library(summarytools)
freq(iris$Species, style = "rmarkdown")
```

If we do not worry about missing data, we can set `report.nas = FALSE`:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown", omit.headings = TRUE)
```

We could simplify further and omit the _Totals_ row by setting `totals = FALSE`.

To get familiar with the output styles, try different values for `style=`
and see how results look in the console. 

## 2 - ctable() : Cross-Tabulations

We’ll now use a sample data frame called *tobacco*, which is included in
the package. We want to cross-tabulate the two categorical variables
`smoker` and `diseased`. By default, `ctable()` gives row proportions,
but we’ll include the full syntax anyway.

Since *markdown* has not support (yet) for multi-line headings, we’ll
show an image of the resulting html table.

```{r}
with(tobacco, print(ctable(smoker, diseased), method = 'render'))
```

<!-- ![Example of ctable() output](ctable-with-row-props.png) -->
  
  
Notice that instead of `ctable(tobacco$smoker, tobacco$diseased, ...)`,
we used the `with()` function, making the syntax less redundant.

It is possible to display *column*, *total*, or no proportions at all.
We can also omit the marginal totals to have a simple “2 x 2” table.

```{r}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(smoker, diseased, prop = 'n', totals = FALSE), 
           omit.headings = TRUE, method = "render"))
```

## 3 - descr() : Descriptive Univariate Stats 

The `descr()` function generates common central tendency statistics and
measures of dispersion for numerical data. It can handle single vectors
as well as data frames, in which case it just ignores non-numerical
columns (and displays a message to that effect).

```{r}
descr(iris, style = "rmarkdown")
```

### Transposing and selecting only the stats you need

If your eyes/brain prefer seeing things the other way around, just use
`transpose = TRUE`. Here, we also select only the statistics we wish to
see, and specify `omit.headings = TRUE` to avoid reprinting the same
information as above.

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), transpose = TRUE, 
      omit.headings = TRUE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

## 4 - dfSummary() : Data Frame Summaries

`dfSummary()` collects information about all variables
in a data frame and displays it in a singe, legible table.

To generate a summary report and have it displayed in
[*RStudio*](http://www.rstudio.com/)’s Viewer pane (or in your default
Web Browser if working with another interface), we simply do like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
![ ](dfSummary-iris.png)

It is also possible to use `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents. In this next example, 
note that due to rmarkdown compatibility issues, histograms are not shown. We’re working
on this. Further down, we'll see how tu use _html_ rendering to go around this problem.

```{r}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid")
```

## The print() and view() Functions

*summarytools* has a generic `print` method, `print.summarytools()`. By
default, its `method` argument is set to `'pander'`. One of the ways in
which `view()` is useful is that we can use it to easily display *html*
outputs in *RStudio*’s Viewer. In this case, the `view()` function
simply acts as a wrapper around the generic `print()` function,
specifying the `method = 'viewer'` for us. When used outside *RStudio*,
the `method` falls back on `'browser'` and the report is fired up in the
system’s default browser.

## Using by() to Show Results By Groups

With `freq()` and `descr()`, you can use *R*’s base function `by()` to
show statistics split by a ventilation / categorical variable. *R*’s
`by()` function returns a `list` containing as many *summarytools* objects
as there are categories in our ventilation variable. 

To propertly display the content present in that list, **we use
the `view()` function**. Using `print()`, while technically possible,
will not give as much satisfactory results.

#### Example 

Using the _iris_ data frame, we will display descriptive statistics
broken down by Species.

```{r}
# First save the results
iris_stats_by_species <- by(data = iris, 
                            INDICES = iris$Species, 
                            FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), 
                            transpose = TRUE)

# Then use view(), like so:
view(iris_stats_by_species, method = "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

To see an *html* version of these results, we'd simply do this (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species)
```

### Special Case - Using descr() With by() For A Single Variable

Instead of showing several tables having only one column each, the
`view()` function will assemble the results into a single table:

```{r}
data(tobacco) # tobacco is an example dataframe included in the package
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   by(BMI, age.gr, descr, 
                      stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
view(BMI_by_age, "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

The transposed version looks like this:

```{r}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   by(BMI, age.gr, descr,  transpose = TRUE,
                      stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
view(BMI_by_age, "pander", style = "rmarkdown", omit.headings = TRUE)
```

## Using lapply() to Show Several freq() tables at once

As is the case for `by()`, the `view()` function is essential for making
results nice and tidy.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
tobacco_subset <- tobacco[ ,c("gender", "age.gr", "smoker")]
freq_tables <- lapply(tobacco_subset, freq)
view(freq_tables, footnote = NA, file = 'freq-tables.html')
```

## Using summarytools in Rmarkdown documents

As we have seen, *summarytools* can generate both text (including
rmarkdown) and html results. Both can be used in Rmarkdown, according to
your preferences. There is a vignette dedicated to this, which gives
several examples, but if you’re in a hurry, here are a few tips to
get started:

 - Always set the `knitr` chunk option `results = 'asis'`. You can do
   this on a chunk-by-chunk basis, but here is how to do it globally:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'asis')
```

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Refer to [this page](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for
more on _knitr_'s options.

  - To get better results when using html (with `method = 'render'`),
    set up your .Rmd document so it includes *summarytool*’s css.

#### Example

````
# ---
# title: "RMarkdown using summarytools"
# output: 
#   html_document: 
#     css: C:/R/win-library/3.4/summarytools/includes/stylesheets/summarytools.css
# ---
````

For more details on using *summarytools* in *Rmarkdown* documents, please refer to
the corresponding vignette.

## Writing Output to Files

The console will always tell you the location of the temporary *html*
file that is created in the process. However, you can specify the name
and location of that file explicitly if you need to reuse it later on:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```
Based on the file extension you provide (_.html_ vs others), _summarytools_ will
use the appropriate method; there is no need to specify the `method` argument.

### Appending output files

There is also an `append =` logical argument for adding content to
existing reports, both text/Rmarkdown and html. This is useful if you want to
quickly include several statistical tables in a single file. It is fast 
alternative to creating an _.Rmd_ document if you don't need the extra
content that the latter allows.

## Global options

Version 0.8.3 introduced the following set of global options:

  - `round.digits` = `2`
  - `plain.ascii` = `TRUE`
  - `omit.headings` = `FALSE` (if using in a markdown document or a
    shiny app, setting this to `TRUE` might be preferable
  - `footnote` = `'default'` (set to empty string or `NA` to omit
    footnote)
  - `display.labels` = `TRUE`
  - `freq.totals` = `TRUE`
  - `freq.display.nas` = `TRUE`
  - `ctable.totals` = `TRUE`
  - `ctable.prop` = `'r'` (display *r*ow proportions by default)
  - `descr.stats` = `'all'`
  - `descr.transpose` = `FALSE`
  - `bootstrap.css` = `TRUE` (if using in a markdown document or a shiny
    app, setting this to `FALSE` might be preferable
  - `custom.css` = `NA`
  - `escape.pipe` = `FALSE`

#### Examples

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_options()                      # display all global options' values
st_options('round.digits')        # display only one option
st_options('omit.headings', TRUE) # change an option's value
st_options('footnote', NA)        # Turn off the footnote on all outputs.
                                  # This option was used prior to generating
                                  # the present document.
```

## Overriding formatting attributes

When a *summarytools* object is stored, its formatting attributes are
stored with it. However, you can override most of them when using the
`print()` and `view()`
functions.


#### Example 

```{r}
age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)  # age_stats contains a regular output for freq 
                                   # including headings, NA counts, and Totals
print(age_stats, style = "rmarkdown", report.nas = FALSE, 
                 totals = FALSE, omit.headings = TRUE)
```

Note that the omitted attributes are stil part of the _age\_stats_ object.

## Order of Priority for Options / Parameters

1.  Options over-ridden explicitly with `print()` or `view()` have
    precendence
2.  options specified as explicit arguments to `freq() / ctable() /
    descr() / dfSummary()` come second
3.  Global options, which can be set with `st_options`, come third

## Customizing looks with CSS

Version 0.8 of *summarytools* uses *RStudio*’s [htmltools
package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)
and version 4 of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)’s cascading
stylesheets.

It is possible to include your own *css* if you wish to customize the
look of the output tables. See the documentation for the package’s
`print.summarytools()` function for details, but here is a quick example
to give you the gist of it.

#### Example

Say you need to make the font size really small, smaller than by using
the `st-small` class as seen in a previous example. For this, you would
create a CSS file - let’s call it “custom.css” - containing a class such
as the following:

```css
.table-condensed {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

Then, to apply it to a *summarytools* object and display it in your browser:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
     table.classes = 'table-condensed')
```

## Working with _shiny_ apps

To include _summarytools_ functions into _shiny_ apps, it is recommended that you:

 - set `bootstrap.css = FASE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - adjust the size of the graphs in `dfSummary()` 
 - set `omit.headings` to `TRUE`
 
#### Example

```r
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      omit.headings = TRUE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

## Getting Most Properties of an Object With `what.is()`

When developing, we often use a number of functions to obtain an object's properties.
`what.is()` proposes to lump together the results of most of these functions (`class()`,
`typeof()`, `attributes()` and others).

```{r what_is, warning=FALSE, results='markup'}
what.is(iris)
```

## Limitations

  - The text histograms in dfSummary are not yet supported in `rmarkdown`. Better use the
  'render' method. 
  - It is not possible to control the heading levels of individual items. You can however 
  choose to `omit.headings` altogether.
